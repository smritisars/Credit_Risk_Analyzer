## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Required packages (see requirements.txt)
- Modern web browser for dashboard

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-risk-analyzer.git
   cd credit-risk-analyzer
   ```

# Assess new loan application
risk_score = assess_loan_risk(
    loan_amount=25000,
    annual_income=65000,
    dti_ratio=18.5,
    credit_grade='B'
)

print(f"Default Probability: {risk_score:.2%}")
```
